      <h1>16 barriers to scaling regenerative agriculture</h1>

   <h2>   Growing Our Future is based on an analysis of the US food system and brings in wide-ranging perspectives from across the supply chain.  

Among the systemic barriers the report highlights is: 
<br>
1.A lack of consumer demand for regenerative products
<br>
2.The siloed nature of US finance, public health and agriculture systems.
<br>
3.Current market incentives, pricing and economics fail to support grower and farmworker livelihoods
<br>
4.Long-standing supply chain infrastructure being built around intensive specialized systems
<br>
5.Current policy and regulatory frameworks are not supportive of regenerative agriculture
<br>

            <h1>Seven-point roadmap for a just transition to regenerative agriculture</h1>
            <h2>The seven-point-roadmap identifies the key actions that players across the supply chain – including farmers, businesses with agricultural supply chains, agribusinesses, non-profits, investors and financial services, research institutions, philanthropists and policy makers – must variably take to drive change:
<br>
               1.Create financial mechanisms and market structures that support regenerative outcomes
<br>
               2.Empower farmers to build coalitions at the grassroots level
               <br>
               3.Shape policy to build a resilient agricultural economy
               <br>
               4.Build and demonstrate the business case for regenerative practices
               <br>
               5.Engage with consumers to increase demand for regenerative products
               <br>
               6.Prioritize nutritional benefits to enable healthy diets
               <br>
               7. Mobilize landowners to enable regenerative practices to mainstream.
               <br>

                All underpinned by cross-sector and pre-competitive collaboration. 
                The challenge is too great for any one organisation to tackle alone; working together to address systemic barriers, we just might.
